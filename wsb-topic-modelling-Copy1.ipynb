      "* **NTVRK** \\- Just went through the dip a bit… You can buy space, land, ads, nfts, staking. Focus on virtual reality and augmented reality. They’re not just focused in the game side version of metaverse but the roadmap extends into virtual and augmented reality where the metaverse will start evolving into. MANA is only 2D.\n",

      "* **ILLUVIUM** \\- Built on the ethereum blockchain. Turned based game. Not yet released.\n",

      "* **RNDR** \\- Graphics engine built for the metaverse.\n",

I think there will be that high budget metaverse that Meta/Facebook is creating, but there might be a group of people that would prefer a decentrilized/community made version of that like Decentraland (MANA) and The Sandbox (SAND).I think some people will think this metaverse is something you need to live in from an outside perspective but in reality it really isn't. Personally VR for me has been about games; where if something dope comes out, I'll play that game till it's done like if I were playing it on a flat screen and then I'm done. Entertainment for the moment rather than living for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isn't metaverse just basically what VRChat is? I think the metaverse will basically make Facebook more \"present\" than posting a status which is \"passive\". But beyond that stage, what if the metaverse evolves into something that is functional and day to day where it dissolves into the background of your daily routine through augmented reality? Once it gets to a point where you can wear Ray Bans and people don't know you're connected to the augmented reality metaverse seems like the next level.\n",
